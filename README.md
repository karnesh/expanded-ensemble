# Expanded-ensemble

The expanded ensemble technique gives free energy as a function of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or surface strength. In order to obtain free energy, we use Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method. The MBAR analysis is done via pymbar python library. It takes potential energy as a input for various values of temperature or surface strength.
